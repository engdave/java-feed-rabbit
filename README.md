# Feed The Rabbit Android App

Feed The Rabbit is a short infinite game loop made purely for me. It's a beginning of my journey with Java development and also the Android Studio environment. Feel free to download the code and made something more out of it. I will try to do more stuff that is actually usable in 2023. But first - small steps, right?

About the game: Move objects (carrots, cabbage, hamburgers) onto rabbit to make him eat it. Simple as that.
